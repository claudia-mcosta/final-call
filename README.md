# Final Call

## Proposal

Create a Javabank-like project in the next three months. It will be a full-stack web application, so you will deal with both backend and frontend technologies. You will have specific tasks for each week (or groups of weeks).

## Groups

    Mekie, Rui, Mafalda
    Vinicius, Crista, Bernard
    Leith, Rúben, Mendanha
    David, Cláudia

## Structure of the first few weeks

### Week 1: Project Planning and Ideation
Come up with an idea and create a detailed project plan: the project’s architecture and technology stack. Deadline: Next Jedi Meeting (where you will present your idea).

### Week 2: Data Modeling
Create your data model and define the database schema and relationships.

### Week 3: Database Setup
You should then create the database and its tables. Also implement data seeding scripts.

### Week 4: Backend Setup
Start your Java project and create a Git repository for it. Develop the backend application's core structure and architecture. Define the models according to your application's requirements with Hibernate ORM.

## Idea

Check-in platform that allows you to book your last minute trip. 
You will be able to create an account, check which flights are available and book them.
Your data will be saved in our database and the flights will be generated using real time information on real flights.

Get ready to book your last minute flight with Final Call!
