# Lucky Trip

## Proposal

Create a Javabank-like project in the next three months. It will be a full-stack web application, so you will deal with both backend and frontend technologies. You will have specific tasks for each week (or groups of weeks).

## Groups

    Mekie, Rui, Mafalda
    Vinicius, Crista, Bernard
    Leith, Rúben, Mendanha
    David, Cláudia

## Structure of the first few weeks

### Week 1: Project Planning and Ideation
Come up with an idea and create a detailed project plan: the project’s architecture and technology stack. Deadline: Next Jedi Meeting (where you will present your idea).

### Week 2: Data Modeling
Create your data model and define the database schema and relationships.

### Week 3: Database Setup
You should then create the database and its tables. Also implement data seeding scripts.

### Week 4: Backend Setup
Start your Java project and create a Git repository for it. Develop the backend application's core structure and architecture. Define the models according to your application's requirements with Hibernate ORM.
